# Drivers of E-Commerce Success: An Amazon Analysis 🛒

## 📌 Project Overview
What actually drives a product to become a "Best Seller" on Amazon? Is it a perfect 5-star rating, a cheap price tag, or paid advertising? 

This project analyzes over **30,000 product listings** to answer that question. By moving through the full data science pipeline—from cleaning raw web-scraped data to building predictive machine learning models—I identified the statistical levers that act as the primary drivers of market dominance.

## 🔍 Key Findings
* **Volume over Perfection:** A high Review Count (Social Proof) is the #1 predictor of success, far outweighing a perfect star rating.
* **The "Golden Range":** Success is heavily concentrated in the **$20–$50** price point.
* **The Sponsorship Paradox:** Paid ads show a negative correlation with organic "Best Seller" status, suggesting they are a tool for market entry rather than leadership.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
* **Modeling:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest), Statsmodels (OLS Regression)
